### Essential Camera Settings Mastery

**The Exposure Triangle:**

Understanding exposure forms the foundation of all photography:

**Aperture (f-stop):**
Controls depth of field and light admission:

Wide Apertures (f/1.4 - f/2.8):
- Shallow depth of field for portraits
- Better low-light performance
- Isolates subjects from backgrounds
- Creates pleasing background blur (bokeh)
- Ideal for Nigerian wedding and portrait photography

Narrow Apertures (f/8 - f/16):
- Greater depth of field for landscapes
- Sharper overall image quality
- Better for group photos and architecture
- Ideal for documenting Nigerian cultural sites and festivals

**Shutter Speed:**
Controls motion blur and camera shake:

Fast Shutter Speeds (1/500s and faster):
- Freezes motion for sports and wildlife
- Prevents camera shake in handheld shooting
- Essential for capturing Nigerian festivals and ceremonies
- Good for children and pet photography

Slow Shutter Speeds (1/60s and slower):
- Creates motion blur for artistic effect
- Allows more light in low-light conditions
- Requires tripod or stabilization
- Useful for water features and traffic light trails

**ISO Sensitivity:**
Controls sensor sensitivity to light:

Low ISO (100-400):
- Minimal digital noise for highest quality
- Ideal for well-lit outdoor photography
- Best for landscape and architecture work
- Perfect for Nigerian daylight conditions

High ISO (800-6400+):
- Enables photography in low light
- Increases digital noise (grain)
- Essential for indoor events without flash
- Useful for Nigerian evening ceremonies and celebrations

### Camera Modes and When to Use Them
