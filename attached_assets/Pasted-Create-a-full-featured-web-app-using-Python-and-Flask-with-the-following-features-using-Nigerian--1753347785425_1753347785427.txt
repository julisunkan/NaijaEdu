Create a full-featured web app using Python and Flask with the following features, using **Nigerian Naira (₦)** as the sole currency for all payments and pricing:

1. **User Authentication:**
   - User registration and login
   - User roles: Admin, Instructor, Student

2. **Courses & Lessons:**
   - Courses with title, description, price in **Naira (₦)**
   - Lessons supporting multiple content types:
     - PDF uploads
     - Video URLs (YouTube/Vimeo embeds)
     - HTML content with rich text editor support

3. **Manual Payment System:**
   - Students pay manually in **Naira**
   - Upload proof of payment (bank transfer receipts, etc.)
   - Admin verifies and approves payment before enrollment

4. **Voucher System:**
   - Admin creates voucher codes offering discounts or free access in **Naira**
   - Students redeem vouchers during enrollment

5. **Wallet System:**
   - Wallet balance stored in **Naira (₦)**
   - Students can top up manually and use wallet funds to purchase courses

6. **Course Pricing Plans:**
   - Admin defines pricing bundles in **Naira** (e.g., 5 courses for ₦1,000)
   - Students purchase plans and receive course credits

7. **Quizzes and Assignments:**
   - Quizzes with multiple-choice questions, auto-graded
   - Assignments supporting text and file uploads, manually graded

8. **Admin Settings Panel:**
   - Manage system-wide settings:
     - SMTP email config
     - Bank/payment details in **Naira**
     - Website name, description
     - Footer pages (Terms, Privacy, About)

9. **Enrollment Logic:**
   - Students enroll by paying manually (in ₦), redeeming vouchers, or using wallet/credits

10. **File Uploads and Storage:**
    - PDFs, assignments, payment proofs saved securely

11. **UI & UX:**
    - Responsive design with Bootstrap
    - Display all prices and balances with **₦** prefix

12. **Security:**
    - Role-based access
    - Input validation and sanitization

**Technical stack:**

- Flask + SQLAlchemy + SQLite
- Flask-Login for auth
- Use secure file uploads
- Jinja2 templates with all prices shown in Naira (₦)
- Flash messaging for feedback
- Environment variables for secrets and SMTP configs

---

**Bonus:** Add unit tests for payments, enrollment, and voucher redemption.

---

Please scaffold with a clear project structure, templates, static assets, and a README for running in Replit.

Generate code modules stepwise starting from authentication and courses, then add advanced features.

**Important:** Use Naira (₦) everywhere as currency — no other currency support.
