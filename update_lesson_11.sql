### Market Size Estimation

**Total Addressable Market (TAM):**
Calculate the total market opportunity in Nigeria:

Example: Food Delivery Service
- Total Nigerian population: 220 million
- Urban population (target market): 45% = 99 million
- Households with disposable income: 30% = 30 million households
- Average annual food spending: ₦500,000 per household
- TAM = 30 million × ₦500,000 = ₦15 trillion

**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM):**
Realistic market opportunity given constraints:

Continuing food delivery example:
- Focus on major cities (Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt): 15 million people
- Target middle-class households: 40% = 6 million people
- Average household size: 4 people = 1.5 million households
- Percentage likely to use delivery: 20% = 300,000 households
- Average annual spending on delivery: ₦50,000
- SAM = 300,000 × ₦50,000 = ₦15 billion

**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM):**
Market share realistically achievable:

- Conservative market share estimate: 5% in 5 years
- SOM = ₦15 billion × 5% = ₦750 million annual revenue potential
