Nigerian cuisine is one of the most diverse and flavorful in the world, reflecting the rich cultural heritage of over 250 ethnic groups. Understanding traditional ingredients is the foundation of creating authentic Nigerian dishes that connect us to our roots while satisfying modern palates.

### The Cultural Significance of Nigerian Food

Food in Nigerian culture represents more than sustenance - it embodies community, celebration, hospitality, and identity. Each ingredient tells a story of trade routes, cultural exchanges, and agricultural traditions spanning centuries.
